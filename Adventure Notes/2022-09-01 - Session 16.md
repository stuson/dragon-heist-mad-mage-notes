# Session 16

## Chasing the Nimblewright

- The four of us run south in an attempt to find the escaped nimblewright
- We run at a high pace while checking the detector constantly to see if we're on its tail still
- We manage to catch up to him hiding in a pile of rubbish down a side alley
- He draws a rapier and we start combat
- [[Prissencolen Essen Alcuisol|Prissencolen]] casts minor illusion to transform his head into [[Nim|Nim's]] and communicates with him telepathically
- He orders the second nimblewright to come back home with him immediately but to not much effect
- We continue combat
- [[Serge Meridian|Serge]] attempts to sever the wrist of the nimblewright with frostbite
