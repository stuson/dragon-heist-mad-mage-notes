# Session 24

## After the Fight

- The guards release their dogpiled captain
- After becoming unconscious, [[Hyustus Staget|Hyustus]] has changed form into a doppelganger
- The guards sheepishly release us from our cells as we were arrested on the so-called captain's orders
- We grab our stuff and go

## Collecting the Construct

- We go to collect our mechanical elephant
- [[Serge Meridian|Serge]] signs on the dotted line and we take away the pygmy elephant to keep
- We also manage to loan the large elephant by paying for it
  - [[Nanny]] haggles them down to 230 dragons for it
- We are responsible for paying for any damages to the elephant
- The pygmy elephant is still buggy since it's only been a day since we set off but [[Serge Meridian|Serge]] can spend 3 long rests tinkering with it to get it tested and repaired
- We call the pygmy elephant "[[Pyg]]"
