# Session 11

## Kaboom

- Following the large explosion we go outside to see what's happening
- The explosion occurred on the street pretty close outside our pub
- There aren't any buildings heavily damaged or on fire but the explosion did leave eleven bodies in its wake
- We talk to some witnesses
  - A cloaked man took something from the body of a dead gnome and limped away towards [[The Bent Nail]]  ^248470
  - Someone puppet-like on the rooftop hurled something at the halflings which exploded
- [[Nanny]] has a good look around [[The Bent Nail]] but doesn't find anyone in there, nor any kind of hiding places or secret passageways
- [[Leon Margaster|Leon]] checks out the manhole nearby but can't see in the dark
- [[Prissencolen Essen Alcuisol|Colin]] also goes down and throws a blind fire bolt but only hits one of a group of people that we presume to be the Dungsweepers
- [[Serge]] finishes casting detect magic and finds a child holding onto a necklace which he threateningly confiscates
- A sergeant of the City Watch and a member of the Watchful Order come to investigate and interview
- Gnome was being pursued by a couple of people
- Neither gnome nor pursuers saw the blast coming
- Gnome was coming up from the south entrance
- They know [[Serge]] took the necklace so in the end [[Nanny]] has to come over and get it from me to hand in to the authorities
