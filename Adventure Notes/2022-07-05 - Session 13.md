# Session 13

## Nimblewright Detection

- We walk all the way back up to [[Trollskull Manor]] without the detector going off
- The detector stops whizzing as we pass the Street of the Singing Dolphin (due to distance from [[Nim]])
- As [[Serge Meridian|Serge]] walks to the eastern end of the alley the detector starts going off lightly
- [[Renaer Neverember]] comes to the door of our pub and has a conversation with  [[Leon Margaster|Leon]]
- The gnome could possibly have been a spy for [[Dagult Neverember]] who was out to recover [[The Stone of Golorr]] and deliver it to Neverwinter
- We follow the detector down to a crossroads on Saerdoun Street where it reaches the peak of intensity
- There is a particularly fancy mansion here that stands out
- There is no response when we ring the doorbell except for some dog growling and barking
- [[Nanny]] takes the detector up with her as she flies to some higher-up windows to get a peek through a window
