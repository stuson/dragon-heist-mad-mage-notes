# Session 18

## City of the Dead

- [[Leon Margaster|Leon]] gathers the nimblewright pieces in a sack and we march off to the [[City of the Dead]]
- We pass the guards at the entrance on Coffinmarch Street with the usual "it's a nimblewright" excuse
  - They let us know the cemetery is closing in 30 mins
- We see the glass orbs that congregate in the [[City of the Dead]] each night
- We decide to go straight to the marked mausoleum considering our time limit
- At the mausoleum we see the name "[[Cassalanter]]" engraved, the same name as written on the map
  - We recognise the name as a Waterdavian noble family
  - [[Leon Margaster|Leon]] knows they are one of the richest families in Waterdeep, they deal mostly in banking and rumour-mongering
- The door to the mausoleum is locked
- [[Nanny]] casts prestidigitation to put hot metal into the keyhole, acting as thieves tools but cannot open the door
- [[Serge Meridian|Serge]] uses misty step to get inside by himself

## Inside the Mausoleum

- There are a few coffins, stairs going down, and a number of dusty footprints
- There are some fresh corpses here, dressed in black robes with red hem
  - There are two men and one woman
- A closer look at the corpses and the woman appears to still be breathing, but unconscious
- One of them has a red pentagram, similar to at the Gralhund's house
- The coffins are the same as upstairs, just a name engraved
- One of the coffins is in a crude extension, despite there being empty pedestals for coffins in the main section
  - The name reads "Hilda Cassalanter"
