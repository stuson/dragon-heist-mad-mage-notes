# Session 14

## The Nimblewright-Detected House

- Through a crack in the door [[Prissencolen Essen Alcuisol|Prissencolen]] sees a couple of horses
- [[Nanny]] does a quick tour of the 1st floor, looking through windows
- She sees some staff in one of the rooms, huddled and scared
- She then knocks quietly on the window
  - They seem apprehensive and confused
  - They try communicating a request for help through gestures
  - They open the window slightly and say [[The Zhentarim]] are attacking Lord and Lady Graland
- We get the nine servants in the room down via a rope, and one of them leads [[Leon]], [[Whitelaw]], and [[Serge Meridian|Serge]] around the back to let us in a different entrance into the garden
  - There is a groundsman with some guard dogs in there but he can lead us through to prevent any troubles with that
- We enter into a room with many dead people and two people presumably from [[The Zhentarim]], the latter of whom attack us and we subsequently defeat
