# Session 21

- With the fog cloud covering the room, the fight continues in blind fashion
- The cultists are killed and the devil that came up to the window is beaten down
- [[Nanny]] pursues the devil carrying [[The Stone of Golorr]] who has disappeared down the streets since starting the fight
- The room seems kitted out for actual, reasonably comfortable living
- We take the cloaks in the armoir as a possible future cultist disguise
- Side room looks clean but a little dilapidated, with a pentagram painted with blood on the floor
- The rest of the group shuttles off to find [[Nanny]]
