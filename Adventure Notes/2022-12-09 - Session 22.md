# Session 22

- We walk in the last direction that we saw [[Nanny]] go and come across a dead spined devil with a sign above a sewer opening
- We go down into the sewer to look for her
- We meet up with [[Nanny]] who is waiting outside a door after hearing some panicked noises inside
- [[Leon Margaster|Leon]] busts down the door and we enter to see three children huddled together
- Their names are Nat, Jenks, and Squiddly
- This room is their clubhouse and they hang out here
- The stone is "alive" in the other room or something like that
- We go into the other room and there is a rocking chair above [[The Stone of Golorr]] that Jenks says wasn't there a second ago
- The rocking chair is actually a mimic, which we kill
- The stone is now ours
- To stop the kids blabbing about us we pretend to accidentally let slip that we're from [[Xanathar's Guild]] and bribe the children into keeping it a secret
- [[Serge Meridian|Serge]] casts identify on the stone
  - It is magical and requires attunement
  - While you are attuned to it you can't be frightened, but must eat and drink six times the normal amount each day
  - Once attuned you can cast Legend Lore with 3 charges, replenishes 1d3 charges each dawn
- We decide to go back home after a long day
- On our way we are accosted by the City Watch
- We have been implicated in a crime, destruction of livestock by putting somebody's doves to sleep in the sky and letting them fall to their death
- We have some back and forth about the charges and try to come up with a scenario where we don't go to the holding cell with the stone and risk its capture
- In the end we have to go with the officer to avoid any greater trouble
- We're searched and give up our weapons, but [[Nanny]] manages to keep her weapon since it's described as an umbrella
