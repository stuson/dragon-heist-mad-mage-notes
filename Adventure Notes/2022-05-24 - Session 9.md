# Session 9

## Interrogating the Drow

- After successfully knocking the drow unconscious we know try to find more information from him
- We tie him up and drag him down a manhole as the city watch arrive
- Some interviews are conducted by the watch on the surface and we then hear them leave
- [[Leon Margaster|Leon]] heals him to wake him up and begins questioning
- He's very clearly racist against non-drow elves
- He beheads them to look cool
- [[Nanny]] asks "good cop or bad cop" and, by request, becomes "absolutely insane cop"
- His boss is [[Jarlaxle]]
- He's part of a group but he's mostly acting independently on these murder missions
- [[Nanny]] stabs him to finish him off, makes the body invisible, and moves the body to by a different manhole
- We sell some items that the drow had on him for a total of 2250 dragons

## The Next Morning - 1st Myrtul

- We go to report our findings at [[The Yawning Portal]]
  - We talk about how the problem has been dealt with and ask about [[Jarlaxle]]
- A group of drow recently came to the docks called [[Bregan D'aerthe]]
- They've been around for a month or so
- (btw there's a carnival on the 6th to the 9th of this month)
- We get 50 dragons each for helping
