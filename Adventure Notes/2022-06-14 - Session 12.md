# Session 12

## Following Our Leads for the Explosion

- We decide to investigate the "puppet-like creature" which we believe to be an automaton created at the temple
- We go to the [[House of Inspired Hands]] in the Sea Ward, near the West Gate
- On the roof a humanoid opens his hand and releases mechanical bird that flies directly at us!
  - It collides with [[Whitelaw]] and smashes itself to bits on him
- We enter into the main hall where we can see lots of fabulous inventions on two-dozen pedestals
  - A 4ft tall model of a clock tower made of brass, gold, and bronze
  - A flappy-winged flying machine
  - A miniature dragon turtle animatronic
  - A waking helmet that gently slap the wearer if they fall asleep
  - A red submarine that looks like a jellyfish
- We ask a greeter about any humanoid automatons and she recognises them as [[Nim]] and apologises about him
- We persuade him to leave the room that he locked himself in and start interrogating him about the scene outside our pub
  - [[Nanny]] conjures an image of the carnage and death but [[Nim]] seems horrified and doesn't know about it
  - He admits he created another Nimblewright but lost it about a month ago
  - [[Nim]] gets grounded (lol)
  - We ask about anything useful for tracking [[Nim 2]] and he gestures towards a box of trinkets
  - There's a Nimblewright Detector in the box!
  - It spins faster when closer to a Nimblewright, as tested on walking away from [[Nim]]
  - [[Prissencolen Essen Alcuisol|Prissencolen]] steals an incomplete mechanical mouse while nobody is looking
- [[Leon Margaster|Leon]] asks about the feasibility of getting a mechanical elephant for our grand opening
  - We could possibly loan the elephant or have a pygmy elephant constructed by [[Nim]] for us as way of an apology
- [[Serge Meridian|Serge]] agrees to spend 30 mins repairing the mechanical mouse in the next downtime
