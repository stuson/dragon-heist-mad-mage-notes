# Session 20

## At the Converted Windmill

- [[Nanny]] goes invisible and flies around the building to find the best entrance to go sneaking around in
- She goes in through an open bit on the first floor
- The place is a mess with broken roof shingles and bird shit
- The southern room has an out-of-place, shiny lock on it with a sturdier-looking door
  - There are some low mumbling sounds coming from inside
- The ground floor is a similar story to the entrance with broken roof shingles and bird droppings
- In one of the rooms there is a person hunched up against the wall, but they aren't disturbed by the door opening
- In another room some madlads just dropped a turd on the floor
- There are a few other people around the building in other rooms
- The people are all just chilling, doing nothing in particular
- We casually walk in as a group and up the stairs
- [[Leon]] and [[Whitelaw]] break the door down
- The room looks considerably nicer to be in than the others and there are three spined devils and the two betrayers
- They hand [[The Stone of Golorr]] to the devils who start fly away with it
- Each of us gets an action as we barge in, and [[Nanny]] puts two of the devils to sleep, including the one currently holding the stone
- Some clownish shenanigans with charms, smoke, and sleep happens
- We'll continue combat next session
