# Session 8

## Mirt's House

- We tell Mirt about our info from [[Maxine]] and [[Yagra Stonefist]]
- He's a bit cautious of our trustworthiness when it comes to "infiltrating" [[The Zhentarim]], but for now we're continuing with it
- He also reminds us our goal is the elimination of gangs and not just peace between the two, but our fist step is to stop the killings in the street

## Dock Ward

- We go to a tavern in the dock ward to investigate the killings
- I interview a table
  - All victims were very drunk
  - All victims were half-elves or elves
  - He mentions some drow that don't get along with the elves
- I interview a drunk elf
  - The only significant group of drow here are the [[Bregan D'aerthe]]
  - They're a male-only group of lowlives
  - He's gay
- We decide to stalk (good) the elf
- As he leaves we follow and engage with a would-be killer
