# Session 5

## At Our New Pub

- We get a visit from a representative of the Fellowship of Innkeepers
- He evaluates the place as needing 1000 dragons of repairs to return it to business
- [[Leon Margaster|Leon]] has received a summons from the Blackstaff, [[Vajra Safahr]]

## Blackstaff Tower

- We enter the tower to meet [[Vajra Safahr]]
- She has heard of our rescue of [[Renaer Neverember|Renaer]] and offers us to become a member of the Greyhands, after some sort of probationary task
- We are to find information from a monk, [[Than]] who is in a cave in Mount Waterdeep, specifically about threats to the city, but we must not overstay our welcome

## Mount Waterdeep

- It is quite a climb getting to the cave on the mountain
- We find the simple dwelling
- [[Leon Margaster|Leon]] inquires about possible threats to the city, but doesn't have the trust
- [[Nanny]] eventually manages to get the information out of the monk by building [[Leon Margaster|Leon]] up
- The message from the monk is "evil's twin hides its face for now. Expect that to change before winter's end."
- After we all leave to go back down the mountain [[Nanny]] stays behind to ask a few more questions
  - If he knows how we can be more of service to the safety of Waterdeep
    - He mentions that [[Jalesta Silvermane]] at [[The Yawning Portal]] may be of use to talk to regarding this
  - If he knows how to make a lot of money quickly, to which he definitely does not in his capacity as monk
  - Lastly, if he has any tips for running a tavern, which he doesn't
- We go back to the Blackstaff and report to her
- Next we head to [[The Yawning Portal]] to meet [[Jalesta Silvermane]]

## The Yawning Portal

- [[Prissencolen Essen Alcuisol|Colin]] engages [[Jalesta Silvermane]] in conversation
- He asks if we're familiar with The Lord's Alliance, and if we'd be interested in work keeping the peace, and everything in order
- They're very loyal to the Open Lord and are kind of like *another* secret police (as well as the Greyhands)
- Our mission brief: A gang war is causing unrest through the city, and we have offered protection to the Dungsweepers Guild. Meet on Mule Street in the Dock Ward at six bells and guard them. Do this for a tenday.
- [[Prissencolen Essen Alcuisol|Colin]] has already signed up himself, and the rest of us without our permission
