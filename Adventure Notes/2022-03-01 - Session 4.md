# Session 4

## Boss Fight

- We enter the next room to see [[Floon Blagmaar|Floon]] being held by [[Grum'shar]] (painful style)
- [[Nihiloor]] is watching from above with his lil' brain thing
- [[Nihiloor]] just leaves into the room on the left
- We beat the remaining enemies in the room and Floon leaps up and starts thanking and hugging us (excep [[Renaer Neverember|Renaer]] who is still stunned from combat)
- Following [[Nihiloor]]'s route to the next room we come across a pillar with the Xanathar symbol on it, and an active portal on the south wall
- Everyone, Leon especially attempts to cross through the portal but it shuts in our faces
- We discover a tunnel in one of the rooms behind a curtain
- After exploring the rest of the area we check out what's through the tunnel and come out into a cellar with some stairs going up
- Serge checks out the top of the stairs and sees a couple of halflings chilling in what seems to be their home, so Serge heads back downstairs undetected
- Serge disposes of [[Grum'shar]]]'s body in the ooze room, and also takes the opportunity to dispose of [[Krenz]]'s body in the same way while nobody is looking
- We drag the [[Renaer Neverember|Renaer]]'s unconscious body through the halfling's house, calling for help
  - The halflings are surprised to hear of the secret passage in their basement and vow to seal it up after the City Watch can have a look through
  - They agree to alert the Watch
- The party and [[Floon]] travel back to [[The Yawning Portal]] without incident

## Back to The Yawning Portal

- [[Volo]] is delighted to see [[Floon]] come back safely
- [[Volo]] has a deed to a property as reward (instead of our agreed payment)
- [[Nanny]] is *not impressed*, but we agree to go check out the property

## Our New Property

- It's a 4 story old tavern in the North Ward on Troll Street
- It's been abandoned for a while, there are casks of wine that are all turned to vinegar
- It's haunted by a ghost who's name is [[Lif]]
- We agree to meet the [[Magistrate]] at high-sun to perform the handover
- [[Serge]] compiles his notes in the main bar area while [[Leon Margaster|Leon]] excitedly recounts events to him in the wrong order
- [[Nanny]] performs all the chores by herself and gets passive aggressive
- [[Lif]] moves furniture about and [[Nanny]] rewards the behaviour with a stronger cookie smell aura
- [[Prissencolen Essen Alcuisol|Colin]] pretends to be the ghost with Mage Hand to also receive the rewards
- After staying the night at [[Trollskull Manor]], the handover happens and we are now official owners of the place

**Starting next session we will be level 2**
