- A troll and stirges came out of the pit, making most customers flee
- Durnan draws a greatsword and immediately engages in combat

## Meeting with Volo

- Volo has lost his friend called [Floon Blagmaar](../Character%20Notes/Non-Player%20Characters/Floon%20Blagmaar.md)

## Old Xoblob

- Run by a gnome
- He's got eyes on his cheeks - possibly a gang sign
- Everything is purple
- Purple-buttoned
- The stuffed beholder outside gave off a little evil vibe
- Gained beholder memories in an explosion from a spore attack in the Undercliff
- Tried changing the name of the shop, but people kept calling it "Old Xoblob's" so he changed it back, then eventualy changed his own name
- He's mad
- He witnessed a kerfuffle outside 2 nights ago
    - Didn't recognise any of them
    - Black leather armour
    - Black tattoo of a winged snake
    - He might have seen Floon
- [[Leon Margaster|Leon]] bought the purple buttons

## The Skewered Dragon
