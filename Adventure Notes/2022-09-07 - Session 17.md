# Session 17

## Meanwhile at the Manor

- [[Nanny]] is invisibly observing the Gralhunds
- They're creating a story for when the City Watch arrive where they valiantly defended their home from a [[The Zhentarim|Zentarim]] attack
- Searching the house further she finds a trunk she can't carry, some jewellery with a red pentagram, dresses
- [[Yalah Gralhund]] walks into the room and lets her kids know it's safe to come out and embraces them
- [[Nanny]] decides to leave through the balcony, but on her way she sees two griffons with riders circling overhead, as well as the person who let us in now letting a load of watchmen into the building
- She leaves and starts heading south

## Back to the Nimblewright

- We manage to destroy the nimblewright along with causing a small rubbish fire
- Some members of the watch come over to investigate but [[Whitelaw]] mentions it's just a nimblewright and they let us get on with it (but they tell us to put the fires out)
- [[Prissencolen Essen Alcuisol|Prissencolen]] finds a slightly scorched map with an X marked somewhere in the dead city
- [[Nanny]] notices the fire and starts heading towards our location
- [[Serge]] casts identify on the nimblewright to see if any spells were affecting it, but nothing was
