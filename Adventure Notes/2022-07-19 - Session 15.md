# Session 15

## Continuing the House Invasion

- [[Serge Meridian|Serge]] runs up the stairs first and sees a battle going on between the guards and the invaders
- The nimblewright detector also starts slowing down, meaning the nimblewright must be getting further away
- [[Prissencolen Essen Alcuisol|Prissencolen]] misses a chaos bolt and blast a door down revealing a man with bad vibes
- We put the man to sleep and deal with the rest of the invaders

## After Combat

- A guard comes out to attempt to kill the shady man but we intervene to try and question him, so we tie him up with rope
- The lady leaves her room and talks to [[Leon Margaster|Leon]], thanking him for assisting in her defence
- She says she doesn't know anything about nimblewrights but after some pressing she admits more
  - She reveals there was a nimblewright left at her house recently
  - It stole her necklace of fireballs
  - She doesn't think there are any other dangerous magical items it could have stolen
- [[Nanny]], meanwhile, has flown out of the window with the nimblewright detector and determined that the nimblewright is travelling southwards
- We go to pursue the southwards travel of the nimblewright and [[Nanny]] goes with us downstairs to fake her own departure, but then casts invisibility on herself and goes back upstairs
- When we leave the house we see griffin riders flying above, presumably to come to the house

## Nanny's Espionage

- The lady says to the man that the watch are on the way and they have to get their story straight
- They walk into a room with flying snakes in birdcages and a circle of magical runes on the floor
- The asleep guy is now awake and screaming about betrayal
  - She says "if you did your job you would still be alive" and executes him

**Starting next session we will be level 4**
