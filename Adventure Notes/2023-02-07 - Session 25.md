# Session 25

## The Tower

- We head to the Castle Ward to see the Vintners, Distillers and Brewers Guild
- We get a couple of casks of dwarven ale from them
- We head to the tower and then [[Prissencolen Essen Alcuisol|Prissencolen]] drinks the other cask of ale, getting absolutely smashed
- [[Serge Meridian|Serge]] knocks on the door to the tower
- [[Esvele Rosznar]] and a number of her guards are in here
- She has recently purchased the tower
- She says to us "I know why you're here. If you know how to get in then I'll spit the treasure with your party 50/50"
- We write up a small contract entitling us to half of anything of monetary worth within the vault, plus she must become a patron of the pub and find a friend for [[Pyg]]
- She orders a guard to be friends with [[Pyg]]
  - Luckily, the guard is pure of heart, and truly cares about [[Pyg]]
  - Coincidentally, [[Pyg]] has the ability to detect purity of heart
- She leaves and as she does a number of guild members walk into the tower, from trades such as carpentry, masonry etc.
- We follow her down the stairs
- [[Whitelaw]] notices that she opens the door at the bottom using thieves' tools rather than a key
- There is a teleportation circle on the ground in the next room
- [[Serge Meridian|Serge]] casts Alarm on the room
- A further 90ft descent down some stairs
- There is a 20ft wide double-door with no handles or hinges with text asking to bring forth the three keys
- We present the keg, the [[Pyg||construct]], and the [[Prissencolen Essen Alcuisol|drunk half-elf]]
- The doors swing open and we enter the chamber
- [[Leon Margaster|Leon]] retrieves the undrunk ale and then cures [[Prissencolen Essen Alcuisol|Prissencolen]] of his inebriation
