# Session 7

## The Market

- On our way back in our separate taxis from the show we gather information on [[Maxine]]
  - She spends her mornings at the market
  - [[Nanny]] also advertises our new pub
- In the morning we head to the market and
- I start a conversation with [[Maxine]] (after asking her driver for permission)
  - A few days ago she picked up a half-elf and his bodyguard at an intersection and dropped them off at the Yawning Portal
  - They talked about hiring spies to root out Xanathar Guild hideouts through the city
  - She describes the two people, one of which is [[Yagra Stonefist]]
- I then interview her personally
  - She couldn't always talk but one day found that she can imitate the sounds
  - Hauling's the only honest job a horse can get nowadays, she says *"I'm not good with my hands"*
  - She likes Waterdeep, thinks she's treated well generally
  - She doesn't get whipped because she can communicate with her author
- We board her dray and go to [[Mirt|Mirt's]] house, but he's not in
  - [[Nanny]] goes around the back and speaks to a servant to confirm this
- We decide to further our investigation until he comes back, so we head to [[The Yawning Portal]] once more
- [[Leon Margaster|Leon]] approaches [[Yagra Stonefist|Yagra]]
  - They make small talk about the last time we saw her
  - Subtly talking about how much he hates [[Xanathar's Guild]], [[Leon Margaster|Leon]] manages to get a job offer from
  - Another faction has sprung up within [[The Zhentarim]], and has instigated the gang war with [[Xanathar's Guild]]
  - [[Yagra Stonefist]] only wants an end to the widespread violence
  - She says that elf and half-elf sailors are being killed, and the City Watch could certainly need a hand with it
  - We'll each receive 50 dragons for providing our help
- [[Mirt]] is now in, and we knock on the door
