# Session 19

# The Mausoleum Adventure Continues

- Believe it or not, [[Serge Meridian|Serge]] hadn't tried the door yet, so he opens it for the rest of the team
- [[Serge Meridian|Serge]] tries to identify magical properties of the pentagram but only identifies it as a symbol of Asmodeus
- The cultists have all been stabbed, including the woman who still lives
- [[Leon Margaster|Leon]] heals the unconscious woman so we can ask her questions
- The woman's name is Vaelle Lurval and she was there for an exchange of [[The Stone of Golorr]]
- They were betrayed by [[Arn Xalrondar]] and [[Seffia Naelryke]], who stabbed her, her boyfriend, and another cultist and ran off with the stone
- She's being upfront about this info because she wants revenge against the two betrayers
- The stone was dropped off by a "mechanical fellow" earlier
- She's not a member of [[The Zhentarim]], just a demon-worshipping florist
- They were supposed to take the stone to a converted windmill on Coach Lamp Lane in the South Ward
- [[Prissencolen Essen Alcuisol|Prissencolen]] reads her mind to get the likeness of the betrayers, then recreates them with Minor Illusion which [[Nanny]] copies down with Prestidigitation
- [[Nanny]] waits behind as we go outside of the Mausoleum for some air and then kills Vaelle
- She comes upstairs and lets us know that she succumbed to her wounds
- We then go off to the previously mentioned windmill, dragging the nimblewright parts with us
