# Session 10

## Sorting Out the Pub

- We speak to a solicitor to help get a variety of contractors in to do up the pub
- It will cost about 1150 dragons in total including solicitor's fees
- After much deliberation we decide on the name [[The Leon Hands]]
- It is late afternoon by the time we get everything sorted out with the solicitor
- We go shopping with our wads of cash
- After a busy day of shopping we go to bed
- We're woken up the morning by a window-smashing explosion and smoke
