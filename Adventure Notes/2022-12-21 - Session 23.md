# Session 23

## In the Holding Cell

- [[Nanny]] casts Magic Mouth on [[The Stone of Golorr]] to make a long, annoying noise if somebody not in the group touches the stone
- [[Serge Meridian|Serge]] casts three of the Legend Lore charges of the stone asking about the hidden embezzled wealth of [[Dagult Neverember]]
  - It tells us that he keeps the lair in a decrepit old tower in the Dock Ward, and is guarded by a Gold Dragon called Aurinax
  - There are three keys to the vault
    - An animated construct must be brought to the door
    - An intoxicated half-elf or elf
    - A cask of dwarven ale
  - The only people who know how to access the vault at the moment are our party and [[Dagult Neverember]]
- At dawn we see [[Hyustus Staget]] creep down the corridor and suddenly kills a guard with his bare hands!
- He unlocks our cell door and tells us to escape
- He says the justice system is corrupt and will sentence us to death no matter what and to give him our valuables for safekeeping
- We don't believe him, and in response he calls out for guards to come
- [[Serge Meridian|Serge]] tries to run but is standing behind [[Nanny]] and [[Whitelaw]] and can't get out
- Combat starts but we don't attack until [[Hyustus Staget|Hyustus]] makes the first move against [[Leon Margaster|Leon]], then a couple of aggressive readied-actions are let loose
- A huge swarm of guards arrive from down the corridor
- [[Hyustus Staget|Hyustus]] says that we killed the guard with our bare hands and are attempting to escape
- Due to the situation before them with us still in our cells we convince the guard that something fishy is going on
- The guard all start dogpiling on [[Hyustus Staget|Hyustus]] and combat ends as he is incapacitated
- [[Whitelaw]] casts Zone of Truth to gain some info, but fails
