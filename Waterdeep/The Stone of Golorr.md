# The Stone of Golorr

- Stolen
- The Zhentarim believe it is a way to get to the embezzled money of [[Dagult Neverember]]
-  It is magical and requires attunement
  - While you are attuned to it you can't be frightened, but must eat and drink six times the normal amount each day
  - Once attuned you can cast Legend Lore with 3 charges, replenishes 1d3 charges each dawn
